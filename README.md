CodePath Final Projec: To Do List
=============

[Rick James!](https://github.com/sayheyrickjames), [Rebecca Goldman](https://github.com/rebeccagoldman), and [Jeff Smith's](https://github.com/jeffpersonified) final project for CodePath is none other than a to-do list.

We want to incorporate the accelerator, dynamic gestures, "organic" circles to reimagine what a to-do list can look like.

Our (basic) wires are attached, but the vision is that a task to be done would be represented by a circle. These circles would be fairly organic or bubble like in appearance and interaction; they will constantly slightly float and change in dimension, they can be popped, and they can be merged.

Once created, a task bubble can be given a label and pinching will change the task's size, with a large bubble representing a difficult/big task and a small representing a minor/short task. Once done with editing the task, the user will be redirected to the view containing all other task, a screen full of task bubbles. The boundaries of the screen's view will act as a boundary on the bubbles. Likewise, the size of each task bubble will alter its behavior. If a user wants to sort tasks by difficulty, small to large, they can tip their device's top away from them. If they'd like to sort with large task bubbles on top, the user can tilt their device toward themselves.

Once a task is complete, a user can double tap a bubble and that task bubble will pop and be removed from the to-do list.
